Botify Tool Credits

For your protection, our secure payment gateway partner stores your complete billing information. You agree to pay Botify for all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize Botify to charge your chosen credit card (your “Payment Method”) for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. Botify reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If Botify does not receive payment from your Payment Method, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account on demand.</p><h3>6.3.

Recurring Billing</h3><p>All of our subscription plans use recurring billing. If you elect to pay for the Subscription Period on a monthly basis, then you will automatically be charged the Subscription Fee for the subsequent month unless you cancel the Service before the new Subscription Period begins. If you elect to pay the Subscription Period annually, you will automatically be charged the Subscription Fee for the subsequent year, unless you cancel the Service before the new Subscription Period begins. By entering into this Agreement, you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. BOTIFY MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.B., MONTHLY) RELATING TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE BOTIFY REASONABLY COULD ACT.</p><h3>6.5.  Current Information Required</h3><p>YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY BOTIFY IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.

Change in Amount Authorized</h3><p>If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you pre-authorized, you have the right to receive, and Botify shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 60 days before the scheduled date of the transaction.

You agree that Botify may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p><h3>6.7.  Auto-renewal</h3><p>Your Botify subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected. Botify reserves the right to renew your subscription at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate provided 60 days notice to you of an increase in fees. The notice shall be sent to the email currently associated with your Botify Membership.</p><h3>6.8.  Cancellation</h3><p>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.

If you paid your subscription with one annual payment and you cancel your Membership, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current Subscription Period; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then current subscription period. If you pay your subscription in monthly installments and you cancel your Membership prior to the end of the Subscription Period, then Botify will terminate your access to the Service and cease billing you for the Service. However, you remain responsible for all charges incurred prior to Botify terminating access to your account.</p><h2>7. Reaffirmation of Authorization
</h2><p>Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Botify is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Botify may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Botify’s right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Service.</p><h2>8. Promotions</h2><p>Any promotion that provides Member-level access to the Service must be used within the specified time of the trial.
