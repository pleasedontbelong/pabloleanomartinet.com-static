<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>This is a small trick I use whenever I must debug something on production using pdb
without (hopefully) disturbing other users.
</p>

<p>All I do is ssh my production server, connect to a <a href="http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/shell_plus.html">shell_plus</a> console or just a shell console using <code>manage.py</code>, and inside the shell I do:</p>

<pre>
pdb.run('func_I_want_to_debug()')
</pre>

<p>Sometimes I want to call different functions, make something more complex so I do:</p>

<pre>
In [1]: def test():
   ...:     import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
   ...:     func_I_want_to_debug()
   ...:     something else()
   ...:     

In [2]: test()
> <ipython-input-1-8b87adab2df3>(3)test()
-> func_I_want_to_debug()
(Pdb) s
</pre>

<p>And then the fun part begins :) Of course, you have to be careful! you could trigger some events you don't want to
or save some thing you dont want to. I only proceed like this when It's hard (impossible)
to reproduce the bug locally or on a pre-prod environment.</p>

<p>Finally if you have a long process, and you don't want to spend your day
pressing 'n' until you arrive to the exception, you can enable the pdb mode on ipython
using <code>%pdb</code> and it will start the debugger on every uncaught exception</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>If you're not familiar with pdb, it is an interactive module that allows you
execute your code step by step, You can read more
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">here</a>, but the most
important commands are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>s (step)</code>: It will try to go inside the current function, property, class, etc.</li>
<li><code>n (next)</code>: It will execute the current line and move to the next line.</li>
<li><code>c (continue)</code>: Continue execution and stops only if there's another breakpoint.</li>
<li><code>q (quit)</code>: Exits everything raising an exception.</li>
<li><code>l (list)</code>: shows the code around the current line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint</h2>

<p>If you can, use <code>ipdb</code> instead of <code>pdb</code> like this:</p>

<pre>
  import ipdb
  ipdb.set_trace()
</pre>

<p><code>ipdb</code> has an autocomplete!!! \o/</p>

<p>Happy debugging!</p>
