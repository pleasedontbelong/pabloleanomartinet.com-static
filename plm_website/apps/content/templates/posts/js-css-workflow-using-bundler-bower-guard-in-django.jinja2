  <p>This is how I work everyday with JS/CSS. The objective is to make my life easier, so after looking for a few tools on the net, I decided to go with bundler, bower and guard. So I made this presentation to explain a little bit the benefits of using them by making a simple test website.</p>
  <p>Step by step we started with a boilerplate and installed all the gems needed (compass, guard, sass) then we installed bower and downloaded all the libraries needed (Bootstrap). Finally after a few changes on the CSS code we installed Guard to show how life gets easier with it. It&#8217;s not a perfect workflow, but its useful</p>
  <p>the presentation is here:</p>

  <p>You&#8217;ll find two branches, the &#8220;master&#8221; that contains a black site, and the &#8220;final&#8221; branch that contains the running site.</p>
